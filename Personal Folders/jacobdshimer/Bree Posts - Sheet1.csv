"I want to highlight the work of the Tranformative Teaching and Learning Graduate Commitee lead by Dr. Bonnie Ferri. My involvement started with a conversation with Dr. Ferri regarding the state of the graduate student role and idea that I have for altering the framework in which we view graduate student and their contribution to the broader Georgia Tech Commitee. I was excited to learn that there is a whole team of professionals: Graduate Students, Faculty, and administrators working together on the TTL commitees to implement data-based to improve our graduate programs. One of these members, Director James Black, PhD (pictured below!) has been an encouraging advocate of  empowering our graduate students. In that spirit, I was proud to present my new idea for expanding the role of graduate students in fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to the commitee, The Human-Augmented Analytics Group (HAAG). It was wonderful to received feedback and incite on the launch of this idea and I even had a few faculty express working with us in the fall! Learn more here: https://lnkd.in/gD4jygBcI am very appreciative of the transformative teaching and learnings groups commitment to centering student voices in the pursuit of better support for the next generations of graduates students.

"Last month, I was invited to speak with the Georgia Tech Online Computer Science Masters students. I have had the absolute pleasure of working with a few OMSCS students and alumni Jasmine Tata, Jeanette Schofield, Junsoo Park, and Thomas Bowlin who have and are completing innovative research in the McGrath lab. I am inspired by these talented student researchers and I definitely learn as much from them as they teach me. I see the OMSCS students as leaders in the Georgia Tech community as many of these students have extensive industry expertise. We have a lot to gain from extending collaboration with the OMSCS community.That is why I am proud to announce that I will be collaborating with Dr. David Joyner and Dr. Nick Lytle, Ph.D. this summer to expand research collaborations between skilled OMSCS professionals and the greater Georgia Tech community. I am very excited to tackle the challenges of online collaboration because I truly believe their is so much to gain in our science from expanding access to interdisciplinary research. If you are a graduate student, faculty, or other researcher interested in learning about what OMSCS students can contribute to your team. Please feel free to reach out so we can design a project with OMSCS students that meets your computational needs.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQF_lcAnjo6SPQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1713490761186?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=asj415e4mqmrIALk_0-DQMaQ8tVVlYDnoWoWfgKpsUs,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQF_lcAnjo6SPQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1713490761186?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=asj415e4mqmrIALk_0-DQMaQ8tVVlYDnoWoWfgKpsUs,urn:li:activity:7187076223309692929,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_last-month-i-was-invited-to-speak-with-the-activity-7187076223309692929-tBYH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
"I FAILED at the 3MT prelims round for the 3RD TIME!!!!!!!!! … AND I will be back again next year! 😎Let me start by saying, this years competitors were very strong and I’m happy for the graduate students who made it to the next round. I think they deserved it. I’d like to use this experience to springboard a discussion about why good ideas fail.If you are lucky, you will be in a space where your new ideas are heard and the people around you will come beside you to see the idea through and advise you on how you can make this idea better. But most of the time you can’t expect this will happen. Here’s why:NEW IDEAS= CHANGEALOT OF PEOPLE = HATE CHANGEWhen you are not in the position of absolute power, you need leaders and peers to co-sign your idea. If your idea requires people to act differently from their default, you have lost some percentage of your potential supporters on the basis of change. It doesn’t matter how “good” your idea is.I say this to demonstrate that it is STATISTICALLY IGNORANT to kill your own idea just because one or a few people don’t care for it. So a few people thought my talk wasn’t their cup of tea ☕️ Who cares? 🤷🏻‍♀️It will be 3 different judges next year and You all better watch out because next year I am coming for the crown 👑 !😂 I share this clip of my failure so that YOU might be brave enough to fail too. None of it matters as long as you dust yourself off and keep going, you will get to where you want to be eventually.",,,urn:li:activity:7185036920492580864,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_i-failed-at-the-3mt-prelims-round-for-the-activity-7185036920492580864-dre1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

"The highlight of my week was participating in a campus video about the importance of freedom of expression on campus which is being championed by  Vice President Luoluo Hong, PhD, MPH . This was such a great excuse to get out of the lab and be a part of the institutes discussion on rights, responsibilities, and expression. I am glad this initiative took an intentional look at the graduate student perspective on this issue. Graduate students are in the unique position of having both having the expression regulated by their supervisors and regulating others expression (leading classrooms, and mentoring student researchers). To me, the most important aspect of freedom of expression is the freedom to skepticism. You cannot create anything new without the freedom to be skeptical about ideas and the current norms in society. I was raised an evironment which was afriad of skepticism. I was taught evolution isn’t real and that females should not be leaders. Now, I am female scientist in a evolution lab who leads a group of student researchers. Academia has given me the space to be skeptical about ideas and develop my own beliefs. I seek to provide this level of freedom to every student who is brave enough to allow me to lead them. My challenge is to other leaders at Georgia Tech that you would also protect our freedom of expression by accepting valid skepticism and listen to new ideas with the same credence you would give your own.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQHTt4pPufiU5g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1711934268233?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=BHyd7uZgU9n1DiaujI6-eCbRy1_pxRrbMfGII1qh8vQ,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQHTt4pPufiU5g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1711934268233?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=BHyd7uZgU9n1DiaujI6-eCbRy1_pxRrbMfGII1qh8vQ,urn:li:activity:7180372756704772097,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_the-highlight-of-my-week-was-participating-activity-7180372756704772097-SbB1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

"A big thank you to all the first year bioscience PhDs in the tools of science ethics course for allowing me to visit you last day of class to share my PhD experience! Dr. Ingeborg Schmidt-Krey and Dr. Shuyi Nie do such a good job of making the concept of biological ethics an engaging and resourceful experience for the first year PhD students in our school. I am glad to share this panel with Marina Haldopoulos. It’s was exciting to share our perspectives on the Tech to Teaching program and give insights on the PhD process. This is a hotly debated subject, but I think the first year of the PhD is the hardest. It’s always hard to find community in a new program and at the beginning it’s easy to feel like your never going to have the skills you need to make it through. So to any 1st years reading this, remember this is a long process and try to enjoy where you are at right now. I know it doesn’t seem like it right now, but you are going to find your place in the scientific community. Comment below YOUR hardest PhD year and any advise you have for the 1st years coming up behind us! 🥼🙀😊 wherever you are in your education journey, you got this!

"I hope you all had a peaceful break with your loved ones.  This year, I am thankful for my amazing mother Julie Shi-Branch has been an exceptional teacher to young people in Florida since I was in middle school (Which might explain a little about my passions as a researcher). Since high school, I have visited her classroom bi-annually to teach her students math and science.  I found an old video of my very first time teaching in my mother's classroom and I combined it with a video I took of me sharing my research with students yesterday! Now, nearing the half-way mark on my PhD, I thought it would be fun to share this journey with all you! Speaking to a new generation is easily one of the highlights of each year for me. I am lucky to have my mother who has encouraged me, but when I was their age, I did not even know a scientist! This holiday season, I highly recommend pushing yourself to get out of the lab and communicate your science to someone new! You could be the first scientist they meet and you might be surprised what you can learn from them!❤️",,,urn:li:activity:7135431220850540544,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_i-hope-you-all-had-a-peaceful-break-with-activity-7135431220850540544-sKYY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

I am headed into my second year serving as a research mentor and I truly cannot tell you how much I have grown through this experience. Working on a interdisciplinary team, provides you with so many new perspectives you wouldn’t otherwise be able to interact with. I can’t wait to see what we will accomplish in together this year. As always feel free to reach out if you have questions on my mentorship experience. 👾👾",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQEmTTQ0mb8Vbw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1690564101910?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=jHGUTUffsvz3FxhaYMXDoOaZtxwNcQTaeJRBu8VlL9Y,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQEmTTQ0mb8Vbw/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1690564101910?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=jHGUTUffsvz3FxhaYMXDoOaZtxwNcQTaeJRBu8VlL9Y,urn:li:activity:7090739781441097729,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_sadly-the-summer-is-coming-to-an-end-activity-7090739781441097729-mfAy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

"Congratulations to my Biology undergraduate researcher for their phenomenal work presenting at the Undergraduate Research Symposium! Annelie Minor , Emma Volkmann, and William Hancock came together over the course of a semester to present their work on cross-species cichlid behavioral studies. Annelie Minor and William Hancock have been working with me since September 2022. I have really seen them grow as researchers over this time. In January, Emma join our team as a Fast-Track Scholar and she was diligent in her studies to learn the previous work in this project.  As Scientist, I feel it really doesn't matter what we do unless you can convey to others the impacts of our work. I am extremely proud of their efforts to share their research with the broader Georgia Tech Research community!I could not be happier with the work that they put in to this project and look forward to continuing our work this fall!",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQEFevAPxjczcQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1685730252251?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=45gJu1Xv1tM2jHyMg4VWVHp6elCpmC8tHp3IVRNB3xM,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQEFevAPxjczcQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1685730252251?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=45gJu1Xv1tM2jHyMg4VWVHp6elCpmC8tHp3IVRNB3xM,urn:li:activity:7070467024946171904,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_congratulations-to-my-biology-undergraduate-activity-7070467024946171904-A1H_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
"I would like to send out a huge congratulations to Harini Mudradi and Asmita Lagwankar on the completion of their first year of Bioinformatics MS. I have had the absolute pleasure of working with these two driven students and researchers since august 2022. They are members of my very first co-hort of mentees in PhD and I greatly appreciate them putting their faith in me to support their development as researchers. Harini Mudradi will be continuing her research in computational behavioral analysis here in the McGrath Lab this summer and graduating in Fall 2023. Asmita Lagwankar has accepted a  Computational Biology Co-op internship at Cellarity, Boston and will return to complete her masters spring 2024! It has been a great year working together and I can't wait to see what we will accomplish next!!",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFgSRhAJ5rW7g/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1685125865199?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=pUSWY-ALwqtEkKCKCvOHmorVoE6n0ZKNY_z1PIgsyeY,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFgSRhAJ5rW7g/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1685125865199?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=pUSWY-ALwqtEkKCKCvOHmorVoE6n0ZKNY_z1PIgsyeY,urn:li:activity:7067930161467293697,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_i-would-like-to-send-out-a-huge-congratulations-activity-7067930161467293697-jeQC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
"This semester I was celebrated with a display for Graduate Student appreciation week by nomination from my fantastic students researcher in my FishStalkers Georgia Tech VIP Program course. I was asked to chose a item which represent my collaboration, so my students help we made a colleague of our growth and experiences as mentorship group. I have been (and still on) a long journey to mentor my students well and to help them achieve personal success. I am appreciative of them putting their faith in me as their mentor and sticking with our group while I am learning to be an instructor, mentor, and advocate. 🐟 To all my FishStalkers out there, I hope you will consider this a symbol of all of our successes and hard-work this semester,  and further I thank you for your nomination. Know that I consider leadership a responsibility and not a privilege of my expertise, and I will continue to do my best to uphold and surpass your expectations for my role.  🐟 If you are interested in my mentorship system feel free to reach out! I am alway happy to help others learn from my experiences (and mistakes haha) 😂",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFC71I6kor27A/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1684628893479?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=4jDHTQ8FAtbsAGDAI3fmlf5MxQwAVsH5oVqng6cGLhw,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQHSGVwg_-HpwA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1684628895093?e=1720656000&v=beta&t=ezz1kKd5pqfo0W7Qe6kPrBh2KHiCvx7i0Llp1SUHIDM,urn:li:activity:7065845724684451840,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breannashi_this-semester-i-was-celebrated-with-a-display-activity-7065845724684451840-sEhz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
