# Read Me (How to use the Repository)

Please read all of the information below on the proper procedures for utilizing this repository.

# Junkyard

Scripts here are untested/undocumented and someone needs to pick them for testing/documentation. 

## Adding Files to Junkyard
First make sure that all relevant files (code, docs, resources, plugins, etc.) are located within one parent folder to represent the whole project/program. Then click 'Add file' next to 'About' then click 'Upload files' then upload the entire parent folder.

## Picking Up Files
First, click on the folder you wish to pick up. Then in the top right click the pencil (edit file) button. Then change the file path above the file text to match your directory within the Thrift Shop Branch (or Graveyard). If you do not have a directory you can create one as you pick up the file, for example:

**"HAAG-Scripts-Repo/Junkyard/Test" -> "HAAG-Scripts-Repo/Thrift Shop/GeorgeBurdell/Test"**

*(If you are proficient with git commands you may perform this on your local machine)*

Within the commit message write your name and what project/program you are picking up.
For the description write where in the Thrift Shop (or Graveyard) you have moved it.
